To the best mom in the world
Musilimat Bolanle Lawal
(Nee Adedeji)

Mom, you're a wonderful mother,
So gentle, yet so strong.
The many ways you show you care
Always make me feel I belong.

You're patient when I'm foolish;
You give guidance when I ask;
It seems you can do most anything;
You're the master of every task.

You're a dependable source of comfort;
You're my cushion when I fall.
You help in times of trouble;
You support me whenever I call.

Your love protects me day after day,
So I’m fearless, safe and sound.
I feel that I can do anything
Whenever you’re around.

I love you more than you know;
You have my total respect.
If I had my choice of mothers,
You'd be the one I'd select!

my mom is the best in the world dont doubt it
i love programming
